                        <p>
                        We refer to Jesus as Yeshua because that is what his mother, his family and all his friends called him when he walked the earth. Separately, angels came to both Mary (Luke 1:31) and her future husband Joseph (Matt 1:21) and told them what to call this coming child. She heard and obeyed the message given to her in a dream of what to name Him: Yeshua, which means salvation in Hebrew.

                        <p>
                        Actually, we are Jews and non-Jews who believe in Yeshua (Jesus). We also believe that the Bible consists of 66 books: Genesis through Revelations — 5 of them spoke by God, the rest of them inspired by God, all relevant to keep and necessary for instruction.

                        <p>
                        The Messiah observed the Sabbath on the 7th day of the week, which started for him when the sun went down, after the 6th day (Friday evening). So do we. Among other things, we also keep the Feasts of the LORD, fasts and festivals. We celebrate these because the Gospel’s and the Apostle Paul wrote of them. Our belief is that <em><strong>if the Messiah and all the Apostles</strong></em> observed them, and that they continued to keep them after Yeshua’s ascension, then we must follow in that same authentic style of worship.

                        <p>
                        Our Synagogue is a place of worship and fellowship. The music and liturgy is a comfortable blend of Hebrew, transliterated Hebrew and English so that anyone can participate freely, without fear of <u><em>NOT</em></u> knowing what they are saying. Some ask, “Why do you include the liturgical aspect of worship?” We want everyone to reinforce these core concepts into their way of life as much as they can—repetition and song is an easy way to learn them.

                        Our services are every Saturday at 11:00 a.m. Our celebration of Shabbat is geared to last until late in the day, but come when you can, and stay for what you need or want. If you are wondering what you should wear in synagogue, we prefer for people to dress up in their personal best before the LORD -- in whatever that may be. Kippahs, prayer shawls and head covering are not required they are entirely optional, as you will see some wear them and many do not.

                        Or both? God promised that he does not change so that we could depend on His Word and not be destroyed. (Malachi 3:6) He is not fickle, nor a liar and every Word is still able to be kept. We need to keep them all, but some have conditions that determine who, when and where it is done—so the doing is not always possible by every single person, but we'll still keep them for when they can be done. (ie: laws pertaining to a newly planted fruit tree—If you don’t have any fruit trees, then you won’t be “doing” this commandment.)

                        <p>
                        <u><em>THE GOOD NEWS IS</em></u> that Yeshua paid our "death penalty" sentence. We believe our salvation is gifted through trust in God's promise (Gal 3:5-8 & 14) that God will not expect double payment of this debt if we believe in His promise: Yeshua is LORD and Saviour. This IS the same promise made to Abraham and we, by accepting this truth, become one of Abraham's children, too! (Gal 3:7)<br><br>The “written record” of my offenses were nailed to the cross according to Colossians 2:14.

                        If I get a speeding ticket and a judge throws it out in court, the speed limit of that road does not change. No one pulls down the speed limit signs only my ticket is eliminated. This is exactly the same message of that verse. Also, <em><strong>the curse of the law</em></strong> (my death penalty sentence) was nailed to the cross with Yeshua when he took my place (Gal 3:13). The law was perfectly kept by Yeshua and He said, "If you love me you will keep my commandments (John 14:15 & 21)." "I am not come to destroy (the law) but to fulfill (Matt 5:17)."

                        <h4>Expertise No. 8</h4>
                        <p>
                        God’s grace abounds and has since the Garden of Eden for all mankind. Romans 5:20 says that where sin increased, grace increased more. The law is still valid as long as there is sin and death. Some laws are solely for men, some solely for women, some for judges, some for farmers, and some for certain situations and times. We can collectively <strong>keep them</strong>, but we were never individually required <strong>to do all of them</strong>.

                        <p>
                        It's also important to note that the law NEVER was a standard for salvation but a measurement for righteousness in a sin sick world—something to help guide us in the right direction. Living in a world without instructions (the law) would be like being caught in the dark without a flashlight. Once sin and its penalty (which is death) are abolished, then there will be no need for guidance away from danger.

                        <p>
                        Sin is dangerous, it’ll kill you. Yeshua said, “Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” Heaven and earth are still as it was when He said that, so nothing has changed and the validity of the law has not changed either. He (and the apostles) said, "if we love Him, we will KEEP His commandments."

                        <p>
                        Man will often say, "It's impossible to keep the commandments." Keeping them is easy, doing them is the challenge. This is so important, it's worth repeating: God’s grace abounds and has since the Garden of Eden for all mankind. Romans 5:20 says that where sin increased, grace increased more. The law is still valid as long as there is sin and death. Some laws are solely for men, some solely for women, some for judges, some for farmers, and some for certain situations and times. We can collectively <strong>keep them</strong>, but we were never individually required <strong>to do all of them</strong>.

                        The Ruach HaKodesh (Hebrew for Holy Spirit) showed up long before the book of Acts, which was a repeat of what happened at Mount Sinai at the receiving of God’s audible Word. But the Holy Spirit has always been here to bestow heavenly wisdom in the hearts and minds of people who want to belong to the family of God. As for the Fruits of the Spirit, the Bible says without them, we do not know God (Matthew 7, Titus 1). It will show up in many ways according to how He made us, but the gift or fruit is undeniably through the Holy Spirit.
